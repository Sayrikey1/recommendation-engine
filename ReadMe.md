## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Data**  
   Load the movie ratings and movie information datasets.

2. **Train the Model**  
   Train the collaborative filtering model using the provided datasets.

3. **Make Predictions**  
   Use the trained model to predict user ratings for movies.

4. **Get Recommendations**  
   Generate movie recommendations for a specific user.

### Example

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load datasets
movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
ratings = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')

# Train the model and make predictions
user_predictions = train_model(ratings)

# Get recommendations for a specific user
user_id = 1
already_rated, recommendations = recommend_movies(user_predictions, user_id, movies, ratings, 10)

# Display recommendations
print(recommendations)
```
